# CF-LIBS formalization — Part 7: joint (temperature, composition) identifiability

This module closes the *honest caveat* of `Inverse.general_identifiability`. There the
temperature equality `T₁ = T₂` was **not** extracted from the observations `hObs`; it was
delivered by a separately *assumed* two-line Boltzmann-ratio hypothesis `hTratio` on a
distinct-energy pair. Physically the CF-LIBS solver never assumes that ratio — it *measures*
at least two lines per species and fits `(T, composition)` simultaneously. This module models
that step: a **two-line** observation map, from which the temperature is now *derived*.

* `observe₂` — the two-line observation map: for species `s` it reports the ordered pair of
  integrated intensities of two emitting lines `emitA s`, `emitB s`, reusing `Inverse.observe`
  (hence `ForwardMap.lineIntensity`) verbatim on each component.
* `joint_identifiability` — **the main theorem.** For admissible `p₁, p₂` sharing calibration
  and atomic data, if their two-line observations are *equal* and *some* species `s₀` carries a
  distinct-energy line pair (`p₁.E (emitA s₀) ≠ p₁.E (emitB s₀)`), then `T₁ = T₂` **and** the
  compositions agree — with **no** assumed ratio hypothesis. The temperature is now extracted
  from the two-line observations at `s₀` (the two matched line intensities furnish the ratio
  equality that `temperature_identifiability` consumes), discharging the `hTratio` caveat of
  `general_identifiability`. Composition then follows per species from `density_identifiability`
  exactly as in `general_identifiability`.

Both `temperature_identifiability` and `density_identifiability` are reused verbatim (neither is
reproven). *Honest scope:* two lines per species is the **minimal** multi-line case; the full
`n`-line ordinary-least-squares slope fit and its own identifiability live in the
`Alt`/`LeastSquares` layer and are not addressed here. Two caveats of `general_identifiability`
remain: the statement is over the shared-catalog `PlasmaParams` (one level table and one
partition function for every species, a modeling reduction; published scope REDUCED), and it
assumes a known, equal calibration `hFeq` rather than the calibration-free setting. `hFeq` is
removable for the stated conclusion (see the theorem's docstring), but that version is not
formalized here.

/-- **Two-line observation / forward map.** For species `s` the observable is the ordered pair
of integrated intensities of its two emitting lines, whose upper levels are `emitA s` and
`emitB s`:
`observe₂ kB Fcal emitA emitB p s = (observe kB Fcal emitA p s, observe kB Fcal emitB p s)`.

Each component reuses `Inverse.observe` (hence `ForwardMap.lineIntensity`) verbatim; `kB` is
Boltzmann's constant and `Fcal` the shared instrument/geometry calibration constant. This is the
minimal multi-line data the CF-LIBS solver fits `(T, composition)` on: two distinct-energy lines
on a single species already pin the temperature through the two-line Boltzmann ratio, which the
single-line `observe` cannot do. -/

/-- **Joint (temperature, composition) identifiability — discharging the `hTratio` caveat.**

Under explicit nondegeneracy (positive `T`, `N`, `g`, `A` via `Admissible`; two emitting lines
per species via `emitA`, `emitB`), if two admissible parameter sets produce **equal two-line
observations** `hObs`, share calibration (`hFeq`) and atomic data (`hgeq`, `hEeq`, `hAeq`), and
**some** species `s₀` carries a distinct-energy line pair (`hEdist`), then they have **equal
temperature** and **equal composition** — with **no assumed ratio hypothesis**.

This is the honest advance over `general_identifiability`: there `T₁ = T₂` rested on an
*assumed* two-line Boltzmann ratio `hTratio` that `observe` (one line per species) could not
supply. Here the two-line map `observe₂` *delivers* that ratio from the data: at `s₀` the
paired observation forces both line intensities to match individually, so their ratio matches
too (equal numerators over equal denominators), and `temperature_identifiability` extracts
`T₁ = T₂` from that ratio alone. Composition then follows exactly as in `general_identifiability`:
once temperatures are matched, `density_identifiability` forces equal `N s` for every species
(hence equal closure composition). So `(T, composition)` is jointly identifiable from the
two-line observations, given ≥ 2 distinct-energy lines on at least one species, known shared
atomic data (`hgeq`, `hEeq`, `hAeq`) and an equal calibration (`hFeq`). It is not
identifiability "from the observations alone".

Assembled strictly from the already-proven `temperature_identifiability` and
`density_identifiability` (neither reproven). *Honest scope:* two lines per species is the
minimal multi-line case; the full `n`-line ordinary-least-squares slope fit is the
`Alt`/`LeastSquares` layer's concern.

*Model and calibration.* The statement is over `PlasmaParams`: one level catalog, hence one
partition function `U(T)`, serves every species. That is a modeling reduction (real elements
have their own `U_s(T)`), so the published scope is REDUCED. `hFeq` assumes both parameter
sets carry the same known calibration, which is not the calibration-free setting, and it is
stronger than the conclusion needs: the temperature step uses only a line ratio, in which
`Fcal` cancels, and in the density step `Fcal` multiplies every observation, so with
`Fcal₁ ≠ Fcal₂` the densities rescale by `Fcal₂/Fcal₁` and closure is scale-invariant. That
`hFeq`-free version is not formalized in this repository.

Non-vacuous: `species = Fin 1`, `levelIndex = Fin 2`, `kB = Fcal₁ = Fcal₂ = 1`,
`emitA = fun _ => 0`, `emitB = fun _ => 1`, `p₁ = p₂` with `T = N = g = A = 1`, `E = ![0,1]`;
then `E (emitA 0) ≠ E (emitB 0)` (`0 ≠ 1`), `Admissible` holds, and the observation equality is
reflexive (see the witness below). The content for differing parameter sets is that `hObs` at
`s₀` forces `T₁ = T₂` via `Real.exp` injectivity and equal composition via positive-constant
cancellation — neither is `rfl`. -/

/-! ### Non-vacuity witness for `joint_identifiability`

A concrete `species = Fin 1`, `levelIndex = Fin 2` instance with two distinct-energy emitting
lines (`emitA = fun _ => 0`, `emitB = fun _ => 1`, energies `E = ![0,1]`, so
`E (emitA 0) ≠ E (emitB 0)`) shows the full hypothesis bundle of `joint_identifiability` is
jointly satisfiable: taking `p₁ = p₂` makes the shared-data and observation equalities reflexive
while `Admissible` and the distinct-energy pair genuinely hold, and the theorem then delivers its
conclusion. -/

/-- **Non-vacuity for `joint_identifiability`.** The hypothesis bundle is jointly satisfiable:
the `Fin 1` / `Fin 2` instance above is `Admissible`, carries a genuine distinct-energy line
pair (`E (emitA 0) = 0 ≠ 1 = E (emitB 0)`), and (with `p₁ = p₂`) satisfies the shared-data and
observation equalities reflexively — so `joint_identifiability` applies and yields its
conclusion. -/
